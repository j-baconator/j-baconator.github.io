I’m Julie Bacon and I build things on the Internet. I've worked in the tech industry building best-in-class web applications for clients ranging from Capital One to CareerBuilder. Every day I get to design and develop solutions to problems where I am only limited by my own creativity. If I see something I don’t like in the world, I have the tools and power to try to change it, from anywhere in the world. In my opinion, there is nothing more inspiring than this.

I also use technology to enhance my overall quality of life -- from my physical and mental health, finances, career, and relationships, -- tech inevitably fits into all of this. This blog covers how you can leverage technology to enhance your life, (including when tech has overstayed its welcome 👋).

Technista is a tech and lifestyle blog that helps make tech more accessible and relatable. From code tutorials, to what’s trending, to why you can’t stop checking your god damn instagram feed, Technista is that friend you go to for all your tech related questions. Except no, we won’t fix your broken printer, sry.

Whether you’re a code newbie looking to launch a new career or just looking for tips on how tech can work for you and your lifestyle, always defer to your Technista friend.
