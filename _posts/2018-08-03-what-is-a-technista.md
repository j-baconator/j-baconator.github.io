## The Girl Behind the Code

Hi 👋 I’m Julie Bacon and I build things on the Internet. I've worked in the tech industry in building best-in-class web applications for everything from Fortune 500 companies to startups to nonprofits. Every day I get to design and develop solutions to problems where I am only limited by my own creativity. If I see something I don’t like in the world, I have the tools and power to try to change it, from anywhere in the world. In my opinion, there is nothing more inspiring than this. 

After talking to lots of coding beginners and friends who see tech as intimidating, I decided to build this blog to share my experiences with tech at the intersection of work, life, health, and finance. Technista is a tech and lifestyle blog that helps make tech more accessible and relatable.

## Tech IRL

I also use technology to enhance my overall quality of life -- from my physical and mental health, finances, career, and relationships -- tech inevitably fits into all of this. This blog covers how you can leverage technology to enhance your life (including when tech has overstayed its welcome ✌️).

## Who's it for?

From code tutorials, to what’s trending, to why you can’t stop checking your god damn instagram feed, Technista is that friend you go to for all your tech related questions. Except no, we won’t fix your broken printer, sry.

Whether you’re a code newbie looking to launch a new career or just looking for tips on how tech can work for you and your lifestyle, you can always defer to your Technista friend for the juice.
