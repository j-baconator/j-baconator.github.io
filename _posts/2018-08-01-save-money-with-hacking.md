## Celebratory Hacking

When I think of “hacking” I think of using tech as a force for good. I don’t think of the stereotypical dude in his mom’s basement wearing a sweatshirt, which is what Hollywood wants us to think.

We’re about to take #lifehacks to a whole new level. Are you about to get married? Celebrating 10 years of friendship with your best friend? Throwing an 75th birthday party for your grandma? Whatever the big occassion, Americans spend hundreds on personalized services.

Companies like will cost you an arm and a leg just to have cute party decorations why not make them yourself?

## Save Your Money

When my brother and his fiance were planning their wedding in California, I jumped at the opportunity to help with some of the design work. They decided on coasters as a party favor, cute table signs for the gift, dessert, and guest book tables, and the quintessential snapchat filter. My jaw dropped when my future sister-in-law said that a Snapchat filter was going to cost them roughly $150. I was able to make one for only $23.

So whatever it is you’re celebrating, roll up your sleeves and get ready to get a lil crafty and a lil hacky.

## Custom Coasters
1. Looked through a bunch of cute cursive fonts on [dafont](https://www.dafont.com/) and [1001 fonts](https://www.1001fonts.com/). These sites allow you to type in for a preview.
2. Download the font files
3. If you have a mac, open Font Book
4. Drag the font files into your font book.
5. Choose your editing program of choice (I used photoshop)
6. Choose a wholesale coaster printer (I ordered through [this supplier](https://www.4imprint.com/product/131166/Small-Cork-Coaster-Circle))
7. Download the file, open in photoshop
8. Design to your hearts content
9. Upload the file to the producer and place your order.

## Custom Table Signs
1. We’ve already got our sick fonts from earlier
2. Open photoshop, new document the size of computer paper (I did 8 x 10)
3. Type in those fancy words
4. Choose a printing service i.e. Print at Home, Home Depot, Office Max
5. Place your order, get cheap frames from the dollar store, done!

## Custom Snapchat Filter
1. Go to snapchat.com
2. Double, Triple, Quadrouple check the event location and time
3. Choose from a pre-designed filter or opt to make your own. You can add custom text, illustrations, etc.
4. Enter the time and date for the event
5. Drag on the map the perimeter for where you’d like the filter to apply. Snapchat will use the coordinate for this geolocation to only display this filter within that range. Don’t fuck this up!!
6. Submit for approval
